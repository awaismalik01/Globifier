                    Part of the Apple user community, 9to5Mac is a blog covering
                    news and reviews of Apple products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The website was originally created as a hobby blog covering
                    news on Macs. Since then, 9to5Mac has become a blog covering
                    all Apple products and is now part of the 9to5 blog network,
                    which includes other sites such as{" "}
                    <strong>9to5Google</strong> and <strong>9to5Toys</strong>.

                    <strong>What Can We Learn From This Blog</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The blogâ€™s homepage features a colorful and eye-catching
                    collage of pictures and headlines right below the navigation
                    bar. When a cursor hovers over images, they slightly
                    enlarge, enticing people to click.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition, the blog also uses the infinite scrolling
                    feature so readers can explore more pages of the website
                    simply by continuing to scroll down.
